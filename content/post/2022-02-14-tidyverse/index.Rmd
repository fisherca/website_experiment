##Import File from Github

## Call libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
url <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fisherca/tidyverse/main/hotels.csv'
hotels <- read_csv(url)
names(hotels)
```

## Summary of Variables
```{r}
glimpse(hotels)
```
## Select Commands
```{r}
select(hotels, lead_time)
```
```{r}
select(hotels, hotel, lead_time)
```
### You can use attach(hotels) to make all the variables local you your computer. This means that the computer will try to autofill commands with hotel's variables
##Practice with a Pipe Command
```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel, lead_time) %>%
  arrange(desc(lead_time))
```
###you can also do this same code as a nested line of code but doing it structured as a pipe makes it easier to read and easier to understand what you are trying to do
