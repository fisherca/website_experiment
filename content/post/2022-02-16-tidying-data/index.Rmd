##Tidying: The goal of tidyr is to help you tidy your data via: 1. pivoting for going between wide and long data 2. splitting and combining character columns 3. nesting and unnesting columns, and 4.clarifying how NAs should be treated

##Wider means more columns, longer means more rows
##Pivoting longer
```{r}
purchases <- customers %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = item_1:item_3,  # variables item_1 to item_3
    names_to = "item_no",  # column names -> new column called item_no
    values_to = "item"     # values in columns -> new column called item
    )
purchases
```
